#Â hla-book

A repository of programs I've written based on the Art of Assembly Language book by Randall Hyde. To
make the most out of this repository, you'll need (GNU?) `make` and the High Level Assembly compiler
which can be found here: http://www.plantation-productions.com/Webster/HighLevelAsm/dnld.html

The `book` directory contains programs lifted pretty much directly from the book itself, so it is
probably not useful to others.

The `misc` directory has programs that are not full listings from the book, but somewhat like "live
notes" based on the various sections of the book, to reinforce the concepts involved and provide
examples that can be executed.

It's also got some Makefiles to keep stuff a tidy and make my life easier... as long as I remember
to keep them up-to-date.
